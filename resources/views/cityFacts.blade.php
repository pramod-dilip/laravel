Urbanization in India began to pick up the pace after independence, due to the country's embracing of a mixed economy, which gave rise to the development of the private sector. Urbanisation is taking place at a faster rate in India. Population residing in urban areas in India, according to 1901 census, was 11.4%. This count increased to 28.53% according to 2001 census, and crossing 30% as per 2011 census, standing at 31.16%. According to a survey by UN State of the World Population report in 2007, by 2030, 40.76% of country's population is expected to reside in urban areas. As per World Bank, India, along with China, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the United States, will lead the world's urban population surge by 2050. <br /><br />

<strong>Causes of urbanization in India</strong><br />

<li>Migration of people</li>
<li>Infrastructure facilities </li>
<li>Economic opportunities</li> 
<li>Expansion in government services</li>
<li>The Industrial Revolution</li>
<li>Eleventh five-year plan that aimed urbanization </li>
<li>Growth of private sector after 1990 </li><br />


<strong>Cost of urbanization</strong><br />
Rapid rise in urban population, in India, is leading to many problems like increasing slums, decrease in standard of living in urban areas, also causing environmental damage. <br />

The Industrial Revolution in the 18th century caused countries like United States and England to become superpower nations but the present condition is worsening. India's urban growth rate is 2.07% which seems to be significant compared to Rwanda with 7.6%. India has around 300 million people living in metropolitan areas. This has greatly caused slum problems, with so many people over crowding cities and forcing people to live in unsafe conditions which also includes illegal buildings. Water lines, roads and electricity are lacking which is causing fall of living standards. It is also adding to the problem of all types of pollution. 
Urban areas have been recognized as “engines of inclusive economic growth”. Of the 121 crore Indians, 83.3 crore live in rural areas while 37.7 crore stay in urban areas, i.e approx 32 % of the population. The census of India, 2011 defines urban settlement as :-<br /><br />

All the places which have municipality, corporation, cantonment board or notified town area committee. All the other places which satisfy following criteria :<br />
<ul>
<li>A minimum population of 5000 persons </li>
<li>At least 75 % of male main working population engaged in non-agricultural pursuits </li>
<li>A density of population of at least 400 persons per square kilometer</li>
</ul>
The first category of urban units are known as Statutory town. These town are notified under law by respective State/UT government and have local bodies like municipal corporation, municipality, etc, irrespective of demographic characteristics. For example- Vadodara (Municipal corporation), Shimla (Municipal corporation)<br /><br />

The second category of towns is known as Census Town. These were identified on the basis of census 2001 data.Cities are urban areas with more than 100,000 population. Urban areas below 100,000 are called towns in India<br /><br />

<strong>Similarly Census of India defines:-</strong><br />

<strong>Urban Agglomeration (UA):</strong> An urban agglomeration is a continuous urban spread constituting a town and its adjoining outgrowths (OGs), or two or more physically contiguous towns together with or without outgrowths of such towns. An Urban Agglomeration must consist of at least a statutory town and its total population (i.e. all the constituents put together) should not be less than 20,000 as per the 2001 Census. In varying local conditions, there were similar other combinations which have been treated as urban agglomerations satisfying the basic condition of contiguity. Examples: Greater Mumbai UA, Delhi UA, etc.<br /><br />

<strong>Out Growths (OG):</strong> An Out Growth (OG) is a viable unit such as a village or a hamlet or an enumeration block made up of such village or hamlet and clearly identifiable in terms of its boundaries and location. Some of the examples are railway colony, university campus, port area, military camps, etc., which have come up near a statutory town outside its statutory limits but within the revenue limits of a village or villages contiguous to the town.<br />
<br />

While determining the outgrowth of a town, it has been ensured that it possesses the urban features in terms of infrastructure and amenities such as pucca roads, electricity, taps, drainage system for disposal of waste water etc. educational institutions, post offices, medical facilities, banks etc. and physically contiguous with the core town of the UA. Examples: Central Railway Colony (OG), Triveni Nagar (N.E.C.S.W.) (OG), etc.<br />
<br />

Each such town together with its outgrowth(s) is treated as an integrated urban area and is designated as an ‘urban agglomeration’. Number of towns/UA/OG 2011, according to Census 2011 Census are :-<br />
<ol>
<li>Statutory Towns — 4,041</li>
<li>Census Towns — 3,894</li>
<li>Urban Agglomerations — 475</li>
<li>Out Growths — 981</li>
</ol>

At the central level, nodal agencies which look after program and policies for urban development are Ministry of housing and urban poverty alleviation (MoHUPA) and Ministry of Urban development. Urban development is a state subject. At state level there are respective ministries, but according to 74th Constitutional Amendment act,1992, it is mandatory for every state to form ULBs and devolve power, conduct regular election, etc. Under 12 schedule of Indian constitution, 18 such functions have been defined which are to be performed by ULBs and for that states should support the ULBs through finances and decentralization of power, for more autonomy. But this is not uniform throughout all the states and still more is need to be done to empower ULBs in India.<br />
<br />

Urban areas are managed by urban local bodies (ULBs), who look after the service delivery and grievance redressal of citizens. There are eight type of urban local government in India- municipal corporation municipality, notified area committee, town area committee, cantonment board, township, port trust and special purpose agencies.<br />
<br />

Migration is the key process underlying growth of urbanisation; and the process of urbanization is closely related with rural to urban migration of people. In most developing countries of the world where rate of urban growth is relatively higher the urban-ward migration is usually high. Rural to urban migration is by far the major component of urbanisation and is the chief mechanism by which urbanisation trends all the world-over has been accomplished. After independence, urbanization in India is increasing at very high pace, but at the same time there are some problems, which are becoming barriers for balance, equitable and inclusive development.<br />
<br />

<strong>History of Urbanization in India</strong><br />
In 1687- 88, the first municipal corporation in India was set up at Madras. In 1726, Municipal Corporation were set up in Bombay and Calcutta. In 1882,a resolution was passed and according to which, panchayat were to be formed at village level, district  boards, taluq boards and municipalities also came into existence. At that time Lord Ripon was Viceroy of India, and for this Lord Ripon is known as father of local self-government in India.<br />
<br />



<div class="heading">Challenges in urban development</div>

<div class="subHeading">Institutional challenges </div>

<strong>Urban Governance</strong><br />

74th amendment act has been implemented half-heartedly by the states, which has not fully empowered the Urban local bodies (ULBs). ULBs comprise of municipal corporations, municipalities and nagar panchayats, which are to be supported by state governments to manage the urban development. For this, ULBs need clear delegation of functions, financial resources and autonomy. At present urban governance needs improvement for urban development, which can be done by enhancing technology, administrative and managerial capacity of ULBs.<br />
<br />


<strong>Planning</strong><br />

Planning is mainly centralized and till now the state planning boards and commissions have not come out with any specific planning strategies an depend on Planning commission for it. This is expected to change in present government, as planning commission has been abolished and now focus is on empowering the states and strengthening the federal structure.<br />
<br />


In fact for big cities the plans have become outdated and do not reflect the concern of urban local dwellers, this needs to be take care by Metropolitan planning committee as per provisions of 74th amendment act. Now the planning needs to be decentralized and participatory to accommodate the needs of the urban dwellers.<br />
<br />

Also there is lack of human resource for undertaking planning on full scale. State planning departments and national planning institutions lack qualified planning professional. Need is to expand the scope of planners from physical to integrated planning- Land use, infrastructure, environmental sustainability, social inclusion, risk reduction, economic productivity and financial diversity.<br />
<br />


<strong>Finances</strong><br />

Major challenge is of revenue generation with the ULBs. This problem can be analyzed form two perspectives. First, the states have not given enough autonomy to ULBs to generate revenues and Second in some case the ULBs have failed to utilize even those tax and fee powers that they have been vested with.<br />
<br />

There are two sources of municipal revenue i.e. municipal own revenue and assigned revenue. Municipal own revenue are generated by municipal own revenue through taxes and fee levied by them. Assigned revenues are those which are assigned to local governments by higher tier of government.<br />
<br />

There is growing trend of declining ratio of own revenue. There is poor collection property taxes. Use of geographical information system to map all the properties in a city can have a huge impact on the assessment rate of properties that are not in tax net.
There is need to broaden the user charge fee for water supply, sewerage and garbage disposal. Since these are the goods which have a private characteristics and no public spill over, so charging user fee will be feasible and will improve the revenue of ULBs , along with periodic revision. Once the own revenue generating capacity of the cities will improve, they can easily get loans from the banks. At present due to lack of revenue generation capabilities, banks don’t give loan to ULBs for further development. For financing urban projects, Municipal bonds are also famous, which work on the concept of pooled financing.<br />
<br />


<strong>Regulator</strong><br />

There is exponential increase in the real estate, encroaching the agricultural lands. Also the rates are very high, which are not affordable and other irregularities are also in practice. For this, we need regulator, which can make level playing field and will be instrumental for affordable housing and checking corrupt practices in Real estate sector.<br />
<br />


<div class="subHeading">Infrastructural challenges</div>

<strong>Housing</strong><br />

Housing provision for the growing urban population will be the biggest challenge before the government. The growing cost of houses comparison to the income of the urban middle class, has made it impossible for majority of lower income groups and are residing in congested accommodation and many of those are devoid of proper ventilation, lighting, water supply, sewage system, etc. For instance in Delhi, the current estimate is of a shortage of 5,00,000 dwelling units the coming decades. The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (UNCHS) introduced the concept of “Housing Poverty” which includes “Individuals and households who lack safe, secure and healthy shelter, with basic infrastructure such as piped water and adequate provision for sanitation, drainage and the removal of household waste”.<br />
<br />


<strong>Safe Drinking Water</strong><br />

The safe drinking water sources are also found to be contaminated because of water in the cities are inadequate and in the future, the expected population cannot be accommodated without a drastic improvement in the availability of water. The expenses on water treatment and reuse will grow manifold.<br />
<br />


<strong>Sanitation</strong><br />

The poor sanitation condition is another gloomy feature in urban areas and particularly in slums and unauthorized colonies of urban areas. The drainage system in many unorganized colonies and slums are either not existing and if existing are in a bad shape and in bits resulting in blockage of waste water. This unsanitary conditions lead to many sanitation related diseases such as diahorrea and malaria. Unsafe garbage disposal is one of the critical problem in urban areas and garbage management always remained a major challenge.<br />
<br />


<strong>Health conditions</strong><br />

The important indicators of human development are education and health. The health condition of urban poor in some areas are even more adverse compared to rural areas. As many as 20 million children in the developing countries are dying consequent to drinking water. About 6, 00,000 persons are losing their lives on account of indoor air pollution (Jagmohan, 2005).<br />
<br />

The National Family Health Survey, 2006-07 has envisaged that a lot of women and children are suffering from nutritional anaemia and diseases like tuberculosis and asthma are occurring in good number. Providing health care services to the growing urban population is major challenge before the government health care delivery system.<br />
<br />

They have to take the help of private players as public health facilities are poor. In case of migrants, they cannot take the benefit of government policies, so they have to pay very high charges, which keep them in the vicious cycle of poverty. Urban education system also is becoming elite in private institution due to limited seats and high charged fee. The condition of public educational institution is dismal.<br />
<br />


<strong>Urban public transport</strong><br />

As high income individual are buying more private vehicle and use less public transport. Such huge number of vehicles in cities is causing more traffic jam, which in turn decreases the efficiency of public transport. Also the penetration of public transport is less, which make people use private vehicle. Public transport is less disabled friendly. There is also lack of infrastructure and poor maintenance of existing public transport infrastructure<br />
<br />


<div class="subHeading">Other challenges</div>

<strong>Environmental concern</strong><br />

Vulnerability to risk posed by the increasing man-made and natural disasters. According to UNDP 70 % of Indian population is at risk to floods and 60% susceptible to earthquakes. The risk are higher in urban areas owing to density and overcrowding. Urban areas are becoming heat islands, ground water is not being recharged and water crisis is persistent. Here making, water harvesting compulsory will be beneficial<br />
<br />


<strong>Urban Crime</strong><br />

Prevention of urban crime is another challenge before the government of States having more number of urban areas and particularly metropolitan cities. The mega cities are facing increased criminal activities on account of unchecked migration, illegal settlements and diverse socio-cultural disparities, organized groups, gangsters, professional criminals for wishing a lavish life in metropolis. The cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru have accounted for 16.2 percent, 9.5 percent and 8.1 percent respectively of the total crime reported from 35 mega cities. Prevention of crime in mega cities is a challenge before the city government in India.<br />
<br />


<strong>Poverty</strong><br />

Roughly a third of the urban population today lives below the poverty line. There are glaring disparities between haves and have-nots in urban areas. The most demanding of the urban challenges, unquestionably is the challenge posed by poverty; the challenge of reducing exploitation, relieving misery and creating more human condition for urban poor. There is rise in urban inequality, as per UN habitat report, 2010, urban inequality in India rose from 34 to 38 % based on consumption in period of 1995 to 2005.<br />
<br />


<strong>Provision of Employment</strong><br />

Providing gainful employment to the growing urban population is a major challenge before the government. It is generally observed that the literate and semi-literate migrants are absorbed with minimal works, carrying lower wage and more hour of work. The Un Habitat Report (2003) has rightly remarked “The cities have become a dumping ground for surplus population working in unskilled, unprotected and low wage informal service industries and trade”.<br />
<br />

The urban workers are increasingly being pushed into the informal sector and without any adequate activities in the cities were carried on in public places like footpaths, open empty spaces, parks or just in the streets. The plight of rickshaw pullers and street vendor is widely noted and commented upon. As the rural agriculture sectors is shrinking day by day the challenges before the urban sector to provide viable employment to migrating population will be a daunting task in the coming year.<br />
<br />

<div class="subHeading">Successful/Unique/Innovative examples of urban development model-</div><br />


<strong>‘Kudumbshree’ model</strong><br />

It is social empowerment scheme, launched by the Government of Kerala in 1998 for wiping out absolute poverty from the State through concerted community action under the leadership of Local Self Governments, Kudumbashree is today one of the largest women-empowering projects in the country. The programme has 41 lakh members and covers more than 50% of the households in Kerala. Built around three critical components, micro credit, entrepreneurship and empowerment, the Kudumbashree initiative has today succeeded in addressing the basic needs of the less privileged women, thus providing them a more dignified life and a better future. Literal meaning of Kudumbashree is prosperity (shree) of family(Kudumbam).<br />
<br />



<strong>Chhattisgarh PDS model </strong><br />

State government has started managing information systems.It began with computerization of Fair Prices Shops (FPS) and data related with stocks and sales to enable swift allocation of grains. Mobile based applications including SMS alerts for interested beneficiaries were offered which improved the access to information about food grains lifted from godowns and their delivery at ration shops.
In Raipur, individuals are given the choice of the fair price shop of his/her liking, flexibility of buying in smaller quantities rather than in only on transaction, etc. Portability of ration card across the shops helped to improve customer satisfaction.<br />
<br />


<strong>Solid waste management in OKHLA</strong><br />

Waste management is the concern for any urban city with respect to its safe disposal, recycling of waste products and also generating energy from wastes.
Timarpur Okhla Municipal Solid Waste Management project is the first commercial waste-to-energy facility in India that aims to convert one-third of the Delhi garbage into the much-needed electricity, enough to serving 6 lakh homes. It has become the first to get carbon credits from United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in the country in 2013.<br />
<br />


<strong>Delhi metro</strong><br />

It is one of the world-class metro. To ensure reliability and safety in train operations, it is equipped with the most modern communication and train control system. For its energy efficient practises, it has earned carbon credit points from UN.<br />
<br />


<strong>Community policing for security</strong><br />

Community Policing for Students, adopting Student Police Cadet model of Kerala which is a school-based youth development initiative that trains high school students by inculcating in them respect for law, discipline, civic sense, empathy for vulnerable sections of society and resistance to social evils.<br />
<br />

The Kerala model, which is meant for all government, government-aided and private unaided schools, imparts training to students through various camps and classroom activities involving local police personnel who interact with them at regular intervals with instructions on certain dos and don’ts.<br />
<br />

The concept of the community policing is aimed at associating citizens with the local police in solving neighbourhood problems in enforcing laws, preventing and detecting crimes, restoring order and peace in the area and reducing crimes against women and weaker sections.
Locating and reporting to the police about strangers and other persons of doubtful character, assisting local police in patrolling at night in crime prone areas, ensuring timely flow of crime related intelligence from the community to the police and ensuring communal harmony through collective efforts particularly during festivals, religious processions and public functions are some of the key functions of ‘community policing’.<br />
<br />


<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />


Urbanization has undermined old forms of political mobilization based on caste and religious identities and favors local issues to be resolved on right based approach. Urbanisation has its impact on all aspects of day-to-day life. Family structure has also been influenced by urbanisation. In the rural society the concept of family living is different from that in the urban society.<br />
<br />

In the urban society usually the families are nuclear, a very small percentage of households’ have joint families, whereas in rural society most of the households have joint families. This change in family structure is a direct result of urbanisation. In urban areas, especially in the metropolitan cities, people of extremely divergent cultures live together. This has a positive impact. People come to know about each other’s culture and they exchange their ideas, breaking the barriers which earlier used to exist between them. This results in cultural hybridisation.<br />
<br />


<strong>Urbanization in Himalayas</strong><br />

The Himalayas are our greatest heritage. They are storehouses of biodiversity and natural resources which have sustained life in the mountains as well as the plains for centuries. Some of the largest river-systems and basins in the world which have sources here, provide our country with 60% of its water requirement. It’s 9000 plus glaciers and high altitude lake store about 12000 km3 of fresh water. About 1,200,00 million m3 of water flow from its rivers ever year which sustains the great Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains providing food for the rest of the country. The dense forests have been able to reduce carbon emissions by over 20%, a key factor in mitigating and controlling climate change. The Himalayan region contains states of diverse cultures and communities whose lives and livelihood are intricately woven with these mountains.<br />
<br />

As the first step towards recognizing that the Himalayan mountain ecosystems are extremely important and need an alternate development plan, the central government has formed the Himalayan Cell to discuss this issue further. The devastating impact of climate change can already be seen with disastrous cloudbursts and floods taking place with increasing frequency in the Himalayan region. This is being exacerbated by the unscientific methods of dam and road construction which has led to many landslides blocking highways and affecting local communities. <br />
<br />

We now urge you to escalate the process and help put in place a separate development policy and plan for the entire Himalayan range/states immediately.
The Himalayan states and its people definitely need economic growth, but not at the cost of the future of the country. We propose to adopt an alternative model which will ensure economic security of the local communities as well as the survival of the Himalayas and our future generations.<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Look at alternate sources of energy such and solar and micro hydro power (Sulgaon model) </li>
<li>A scientific study should be conducted and key areas across the Himalayas should be declared eco-sensitive zones where no infrastructure, power projects, tunnels, unscientific ways of building roads and hotels for tourism should be allowed to be constructed </li>
<li>Encourage indigenous knowledge and methods of organic agriculture and animal husbandry; promote and support eco-tourism and local village industries </li>
<li>Ownership of forests and forest produces to be given to the village communities to safeguard, manage and conserve forests. States can be incentivized or compensated for ecosystem services provided by the standing forests. </li>
<li>Afforestation as per the unique local flora and fruit tree plantation which will provide alternative source of livelihood to people </li>
<li>Create policies which will help in sustainable urbanization and reduce its impact like a better urban planning process, garbage and sewage disposal system, strict implementation of construction rules etc.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />

<div class="subHeading">Steps taken so far:</div>

<strong>November 2010: </strong>Meeting and discussion with representatives of all Himalayan states in Dehradoon <br />

<strong>March 2011:</strong> A draft People's Policy for Himalayas was released <br />

<strong>September 2011:</strong> Declared as Himalayas Day, various states discussed the policy and put across their feedback <br />

<strong>October 2014 to February 2015:</strong> A 'yatra' was conducted in two phases from Gangotri to Ganga Sagar carrying the message of the an alternate development plan in all states<br />

<strong>March 2015: </strong>A consultation was held at Gandhi Shanti Pratishthan, New Delhi to discuss on the next steps August 2015: Meeting with Niti Aayog <br />

<strong>November 2015: </strong>Niti Aayog agreed to created a Himalayan Cell to study the issue further<br />

Growing tourism in the Himalayas – a spiritual as well as ecological centre for Hindus, Buddhists, Jainists and many others – has brought welcome jobs and money to this impoverished region, but has become another scourge on rapidly dwindling natural resources. In the summer months, tourists swell the population of the old British colonial retreat of Shimla to three times its normal size, crippling infrastructure and water supplies.  <br />
<br />


Cities in the Himalayas have exploded in terms of population and size within a few decades. But the haphazard and unplanned nature of this development has meant that essential urban infrastructure and facilities have lagged behind. From Gangtok and Srinagar, nestled in the northern Indian Himalayas, across to Kathmandu Valley in the central Himalayas, and up to the cities of Bhutan and Tibet, perched amid the snowy peaks of the eastern Himalayas, urban development is concreting the mountain slopes. Gross neglect of city planning in one of the most ecologically fragile and culturally diverse regions of the world has brought a host of new environmental problems.<br />
<br />


Despite its reputation as the “water tower of Asia”, most of the Himalayas’ high-altitude cities already struggle with water shortages in the dry season. Climate change and shifting rain patterns have compounded new population pressures. This not only affects drinking supply, but also has knock-on impacts in areas such as hydropower. Total rainfall has decreased overall; but in some places – such as Ladakh in the arid reaches of north-west India, or on the steep slopes of Bhutan – rain has become more concentrated into fewer and heavier storms, sweeping away buildings and lives in its midst.
